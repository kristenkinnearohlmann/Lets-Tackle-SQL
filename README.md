## Slides
Both a PDF and PowerPoint version of the slides are available in this repo; the [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ilu1yaHQZhLazXJ37y_tkIvsq-Zi7k1CYec3YQ-fORw/edit?usp=sharing) are accessible as well.

## Examples
Examples were written using the AdventureWorks database for Microsoft SQL Server. Note that some of these examples are contrived to show the behavior of the keyword.

1. Simple SELECT and FROM (**simple select and from.sql** || **simple select and from.PNG**)
2. WHERE (**where.sql** || **where.PNG**)
3. INNER JOIN (**inner join.sql** || **inner join.PNG**)
4. LEFT JOIN (**left join.sql** || **left join.PNG**)
5. RIGHT JOIN (**right join.sql** || **right join.PNG**)
6. FULL JOIN (**full join.sql** || **full join.PNG**)
7. CROSS JOIN (**cross join.sql** || **cross join.PNG**)
8. GROUP BY (**group by one level.sql** || **group by two levels.sql** || **group by one and two levels.PNG**)
9. ORDER BY (**order by.sql** || **order by.PNG**)
10. UNION and UNION ALL (**union all.sql** || **union.sql** || **union all and union.PNG**)

Any examples you would like to see or can I explain something further? See contact information on my [profile page](https://github.com/kristenkinnearohlmann).
